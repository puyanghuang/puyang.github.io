<!-- The self-powered wireless switch is one of the successful battery-free electronic products, which can be fully powered by a small mechanical energy harvesting (MEH). In most existing designs, bistable toggling electromagnetic energy harvesters are utilized to extract the mechanical energy associated with the switch toggling motions. Although such MEH modules are already put into volume production, the toggling dynamics and their energy profile have not been seriously investigated yet. This paper gives a comprehensive study of this toggling MEH. The released energy in a toggling action is quantified based on a varying potential well theoretical model. The mechanical–magnetic–electrical interaction within this dynamic system is better revealed with a simulation model built in Matlab Simulink. Experimental results further validate both the theory and simulation. The new insight into these quasi-static MEH systems and their essential potential energy precharging mechanism fills the gap between leading engineering practice and lagging academic study, in terms of application significance, over the last two decades. -->
